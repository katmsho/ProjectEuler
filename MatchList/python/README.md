# Check that all keys of Dict A are also in Dict B. 

## Naive Implementation

First thoughts after reading problem & simplistic implementation.  In no way intended to be best implementation using slickest code. 
Deliberatley not improved on (see following interations) to provide a baseline, and to check that the refactored implementations produce the same output

Checks key names only
    
## Iteration 1

Adding check of value type 

## Iteration 2

Allowing for sub dictionaries via recursion

## Iteration 3

TODO

How to handle large input, improve on linear performance

First assume input is sorted, than can use a search method (start with binary)

Then assume not sorted and build a search tree first
